\section{Aim}
Our team, \emph{Deadline Fighters}, aim to develop a multi-host file synchronizer which can:
\begin{itemize}
\item{allow upload and download of files from a central server (hub) through client applications with necessary authorization.}
\item{automatically synchronize changes made by client applications unto the corresponding copy of the file in the server.}
\item{handle all possible conflict/non-conflict scenarios of file synchronization (ie. combinations of Create, Edit, Rename, Delete) involving multiple client applications.}
\item{enable file sychronization through both desktop (all platform) and mobile (Android) clients.}
\end{itemize}
