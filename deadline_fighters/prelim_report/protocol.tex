\section{Team protocol}
The main method the team choose is that agile software developing, which means that the development is iterative and step-by-step. The project divided into several individual small projects and during developing these small projects, it goes through the requirement, plan, design, development, tests, deploy, review and then go to the next small project.\\\\
There are two types of meeting that the team will be held. The first type is held every week which all members should attend. During this meeting all the team members review the work done last week finding the potential problems and planning for the next week. It usually lasts for 1 hour.\\\\
The other type is held between 1-2 days and this is not for all members but between the members who have the same tasks assigned from last week. This meeting usually does not involve the decision making but the attendance review what they have do after last daily meeting. It lasts for not longer than 5 minutes.\\\\
All team members should push at least one commit every two days. Once a member pulls request on the git, at least 2 members should view changes and approve before it merges on the master branch of the repository. If some members request changes, the member who pulls request should be fixed or give a satisfactory explanation to these changes.
